## ISIC 2024 Dataset Analysis with Multiple Classifiers

### Project Overview

This project focuses on developing and comparing various machine-learning models for skin cancer detection using the ISIC 2024 3D-TBP (Three-Point Dermoscopy) dataset. The goal is to create accurate classification models that can assist in the early detection of skin cancer.

### Dataset

The project utilizes the ISIC 2024 Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes dermoscopic images captured using three-point lighting techniques, providing enhanced visualization of skin lesions for more accurate diagnosis.

### Models Implemented

We are implementing and comparing the following classification algorithms:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

   - Non-parametric method for classification
   - Analysis of optimal k-value selection

2. Logistic Regression

   - Binary classification approach
   - Probability estimation for cancer detection

3. Decision Tree

   - Tree-based learning algorithm
   - Feature importance analysis

4. Random Forest

   - Ensemble learning method
   - Combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy
